# Locality-Sensitive-Hashing
This repository hosts a Python implementation of Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using Cosine Similarity. LSH is a technique for approximate nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces. The code includes the creation of hash tables and utilizing Cosine Similarity for efficient similarity searches.
