# Locality-Sensitive-Hashing
This repository hosts a Python implementation of Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using Cosine Similarity. LSH is a technique for approximate nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces. The code includes the creation of hash tables and utilizing Cosine Similarity for efficient similarity searches. 

This Python code provides a practical guide for efficient approximate nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces.

## Overview
Objective: Implement LSH to address challenges in high-dimensional similarity search.
## Features:
TF-IDF vectorization for text data.
Creation of hash tables using Cosine Similarity.
Prediction of category labels for a test dataset.
K-Nearest Neighbors (11-NN) determination based on majority voting.
## Usage
### Training:

Train the LSH model using the training dataset train.xlsx.
### Testing:

Provide a test dataset in the form of an Excel file (test.xlsx).
Run the predictLabels function to predict category labels for the test data.


## Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn
